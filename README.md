## Do I have something in my teeth? The trouble with genetic analyses of diet from archaeological dental calculus

Allison E. Mann, James A. Fellows Yates, Zandra Fagern√§s, Rita M. Austin, Elizabeth A. Nelson, Courtney A. Hofman

This repository describes the analysis performed in the paper Mann _et al._ XXX.

## Setup

We provide multiple [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environments to allow reproduction of each analysis recorded in this repository, by ensuring the same software versions are used when running the commands as described in `scripts/`.

To set up this environment:

- Install and set up up anaconda or miniconda as described at the [bioconda documentation](https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html), including setting up channels.
- Clone this repository to your machine and change into the directory with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aemann01/diet_calculus.git && cd diet_calculus/
```

- Run the following command to install the one of the environments

```bash
conda env create -f environment-damage_demonstration.yml

```

- To load the environment run

```bash
conda activate qi_diet_dna_calculus
```

## Structure

This repository contains two main directories

- `scripts/`: containing commands, scripts and notebooks describing how each analysis was performed.
- `results/`: final output files from each of the analyses performed.

An additional directory referenced within some of the notebooks is `analysis/`,
which is not included here due to the large size of the intermediate files. These
must be generated by you yourself.
